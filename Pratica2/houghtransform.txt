acumulator array em rho and theta
quantas linhas - contar picos(pontos com mais votos) no acumulator array
It keeps track of the intersection between curves of every point in the image
If the number of intersections is above some threshold(votes), then it declares it as a line with the parameters (θ,rθ) of the intersection point.

opencv - HoughLines() -> It gives you as result a vector of couples (θ,rθ) of intersection points
